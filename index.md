# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 28, 2026

Webomax Bilişim Teknolojiler Limited Şirketi ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Drift mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being fully transparent about how your information is handled.

Because Drift is designed to be a private space for your thoughts and sleep routines, **we have built the App with a privacy-first, local-storage approach.** We do not store your personal journal entries, voice notes, or generated stories on our own servers.

This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected, how it is processed, and the third-party services we use to make Drift work.

## 1. Information We Collect and How We Use It

To provide you with the Drift experience, we process certain types of information.

### A. Data Stored Locally on Your Device (Not sent to our servers)

The core features of Drift, including your "Mind Dump" audio journals, text entries, and customized sleep settings, are saved **locally on your device**. We do not have access to this data, nor do we store it on any Webomax databases or servers. If you delete the App, this local data will be permanently deleted unless you have backed it up via your device's native cloud backup (e.g., iCloud or Google Drive).

### B. Data Processed by Third-Party AI Services

To generate your unique Bedtime Stories and process your "Mind Dump" entries, the App must send your specific text prompts or transcribed audio to our trusted third-party artificial intelligence providers.

* **What is sent:** Only the specific text prompts or audio inputs you provide at the moment of generation.
* **Purpose:** Exclusively to generate the requested content (e.g., creating a story or organizing a to-do list).
* **Retention:** We do not store this data. The processing is handled dynamically by our AI partners (see Section 2).

### C. Subscription and Purchase Data

When you subscribe to Drift Premium, your financial transactions are handled securely by your device's native app store (Apple App Store or Google Play Store). We do not collect or store your credit card information.

* To manage your subscription status across your devices, we use **RevenueCat**. RevenueCat collects anonymous app-specific user IDs, purchase history, and subscription entitlement status to ensure you have access to the features you paid for.

### D. Automatically Collected Usage Data

Like most applications, we may automatically collect anonymous, aggregated data to help us maintain and improve the App. This includes:

* Device information (e.g., device model, operating system version).
* App performance data and crash reports.
* General usage analytics (e.g., which features are used most frequently).

## 2. Third-Party Service Providers

We employ third-party companies and APIs to facilitate our App's core functionalities. These third parties have access to specific data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

* **Google Gemini AI:** Used to power text, audio, or image generation features. [View Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
* **OpenAI:** Used to process prompts and generate personalized text and audio content. [View OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy)
* **RevenueCat:** Used for subscription infrastructure and purchase tracking. [View RevenueCat's Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy)
* **Apple App Store / Google Play Store:** Used for secure payment processing.

## 3. Data Security

The security of your data is our top priority. By designing Drift to store your personal entries locally on your device, we drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we use commercially acceptable means to protect your data during transit to our API partners, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 4. Your Data Rights

Depending on your location (such as under the GDPR in Europe, the CCPA in California, or the KVKK in Türkiye), you have certain rights regarding your personal data.

Because we do not store your personal journal data on our servers, you have full control over it directly within the App:

* **Right to Delete:** You can delete your "Mind Dump" entries, generated stories, and local App data directly within the App's settings or by deleting the App from your device.
* **Right to Access:** You can view all of your generated content directly within the App.
* **Subscription Management:** You can cancel or manage your subscriptions at any time through your Apple ID or Google Play account settings.

If you have questions about data processed by our analytics or subscription partners, please contact us.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Drift does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our associated third-party services. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
